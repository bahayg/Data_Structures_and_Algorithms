// Write a CommonJS module, based on the example from Chapter 7, that contains the array of roads and exports the graph data structure representing them as roadGraph. It should depend on a module ./graph, which exports a function buildGraph that is used to build the graph. This function expects an array of two-element arrays (the start and end points of the roads).

// // Add dependencies and exports

// const roads = [
//   "Alice's House-Bob's House",   "Alice's House-Cabin",
//   "Alice's House-Post Office",   "Bob's House-Town Hall",
//   "Daria's House-Ernie's House", "Daria's House-Town Hall",
//   "Ernie's House-Grete's House", "Grete's House-Farm",
//   "Grete's House-Shop",          "Marketplace-Farm",
//   "Marketplace-Post Office",     "Marketplace-Shop",
//   "Marketplace-Town Hall",       "Shop-Town Hall"
// ];

// Hint:
// Since this is a CommonJS module, you have to use require to import the graph module. That was described as exporting a buildGraph function, which you can pick out of its interface object with a destructuring const declaration.
// To export roadGraph, you add a property to the exports object. Because buildGraph takes a data structure that doesnâ€™t precisely match roads, the splitting of the road strings must happen in your module.

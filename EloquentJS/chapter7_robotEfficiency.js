// Can you write a robot that finishes the delivery task faster than goalOrientedRobot? If you observe that robot’s behavior, what obviously stupid things does it do? How could those be improved?
// If you solved the previous exercise, you might want to use your compareRobots function to verify whether you improved the robot.

// Hint:
// The main limitation of goalOrientedRobot is that it considers only one parcel at a time. It will often walk back and forth across the village because the parcel it happens to be looking at happens to be at the other side of the map, even if there are others much closer.
// One possible solution would be to compute routes for all packages and then take the shortest one. Even better results can be obtained, if there are multiple shortest routes, by preferring the ones that go to pick up a package instead of delivering a package.


// EJS's Solution: (Not complete, codes from previous exercises need to be attached in front)

function lazyRobot({place, parcels}, route) {
    if (route.length == 0) {
      // Describe a route for every parcel
      let routes = parcels.map(parcel => {
        if (parcel.place != place) {
          return {route: findRoute(roadGraph, place, parcel.place),
                  pickUp: true};
        } else {
          return {route: findRoute(roadGraph, place, parcel.address),
                  pickUp: false};
        }
      });
  
      // This determines the precedence a route gets when choosing.
      // Route length counts negatively, routes that pick up a package
      // get a small bonus.
      function score({route, pickUp}) {
        return (pickUp ? 0.5 : 0) - route.length;
      }
      route = routes.reduce((a, b) => score(a) > score(b) ? a : b).route;
    }
  
    return {direction: route[0], memory: route.slice(1)};
  }
  
  runRobotAnimation(VillageState.random(), lazyRobot, []);
